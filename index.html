      <h3>EHCHOES OF THE PAST.</h3>
      <p>
        Madam Darura’s journey began from humble beginnings, with nothing but a
        dream to uplift children from the hardships of their circumstances.
        Starting from zero, she faced countless struggles—poverty, societal
        skepticism, and the weight of a system that often overlooked the most
        vulnerable. But with unwavering determination and a heart full of
        compassion, she established Ajir Happy Kids School. It wasn’t easy—she
        faced financial challenges, a lack of resources, and skepticism from
        those who doubted a woman could lead such a change. Yet, with each
        obstacle, she grew stronger, and the smiles of her students fueled her
        fight. Madam Darura’s vision wasn’t just to educate, but to transform
        lives—turning “zero” into “hero,” one child at a time. Through
        sacrifice, perseverance, and a heart full of hope, she made her dream a
        reality, leaving a legacy of hope for generations to come.
